You'll need to do the following.

`apt-get install --upgrade python` to get latest python

`which python3.8`

`virtualenv --python=/path/to/python3.8 venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

That'll get you set up with a virtual environment where you can install packages purely for your local use, rather than polluting your system folders.

Then check your python version

`python --version)`

Now,

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`mkdir cuc` put your feature file(s) in here
`mkdir res` results will go in here.
